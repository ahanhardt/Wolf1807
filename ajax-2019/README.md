# Working materials for a Smart Ajax

This folder contains a number of files for a "smart text" of Sophocles Ajax, to be developed in conjunction with a "Smart Homer." Our particular focus is on a "smart apparatus" -- developing an apparatus criticus (a list of variant readings) that distinguishes between different classes of variation. 

One goal is to filter variants: help readers identify variations of interest to them from a potentially large set of variants. 

Such filtering can help specialists compare how, where and how often different versions of a work -- whether different manuscripts or different critical editions -- differ from each other in different ways. 
The sample reading room for the Digital Latin Library, for example, already allows readers to filter variants along several categories:

* Orthgorapy: different spellings of the samne word  appear in different witnesses: e.g., nondum vs. nundum: (in Calpurnius Piso 1.1)

* Morphology: e.g.,  different forms of the same word appear: vaccae (nominative plural) vs. vaccas (accusative plural) appear in different witnesses: (in Calpurnius Piso 1.4)

* Lexicon: e.g., different dictionary words appear in different witnesses: praela (wine, wine must) vs. praeda (booty): (in Calpurnius Piso 1.2)

These three fundamental classes of variant constitute a major advance both because they are important in their own right and because the Digital Latin Library has asserted the importance of having dynamic filters. A lot more, however, can and should be done if we are to help the widest range of users engage as deeply as possible with source texts.

A second -- and complementary -- goal, made possible by filtering, is to extend the range of variations that we track. The goal is not to produce a concise an sstatic list of abbreviated variants for the bottom of a printed page but to help readers understand the breadth of fundamental ways that the text can be read. Such a broad view of variants can be extended indefinitely. For practical purposes, we focus upon readings that change the machine actionable annotations.

Different readers may look for:

* Variants reflecting the langauge of copyists that that leave traces in manuscripts (e.g., confusion of different vowels as Greek speakers increasingly pronounced different vowels as -i-). These variants may actually not appear in the textual notes of critical editions as they may rarely or never help us reconstruct the original text. 

* Variants that challenge us to change the morpho-syntactic analysis recorded in a Treebank.

* Variants that do not change our reconstructed text but that change our morpho-syntactic analyses (e.g., alternative ways to treebank the same sentence). Such variants do not appear in traditional textual notes but are crucial components to any fully developed smart text.

* Variants that force us to change the accompanying modern langauge translation.(Note that smart texts must include at least one modern langauge translation that has been optimized, insofar as possible, for machine transation into other languages).

* Variants translations of the texrt as it stands. The range of variation among modern translations will always be substantial but smart texts should help readers asses variants that appear in existing translations and that *could* appear. In the latter case, readers should have access to the best possible methods to determine possible variations in translation (e.g., identification of particularly polysemous terms or of multiple plausible syntactic analyses). Each of these tasks is clearly challenging.

* Variants involving any class of machine actionable annotation that we may apply to a text.

The categories above are open-ended and reflect a fundamentally different nature of a smart text: the smart text is not a static artifact (whether print or unchanging PDF) but a living system that changes -- even if its internal content remains fixed -- because it isconnected to a network of resources available under open licenses. 


* New overlay editions that accept some annotations but change others. We need to expect to see editions that draw upon multiple other online editions to create a new synthetic view representing a distinctive set of editorial decisions. Of course, editors have done just that for centuries but the links between editions can be far more precisely expressed in a dynanic hypertext than in print.

* New translations into any language can be added. The bilingual edition must be the preferred model for any serious publication in a global society. In a world of smart texts, the modern language translation is important not just for those who are comfortable reading that modern language (whether English or Mandarin).
The initial, manually produced translation must be composed in a way to maximize the effectiveness of emerging machine translation systems. That means assessing how well machine translation systems can convert the transltion into other languages and idetifying ambiguities that cause problems for automated systems. Machine translation because part of the translation process. 
A reader working with a Classical Chinese smart text translated into Mandarin should be able to create a new modern language translation aligned to the Classical Chinese text and with a reasoned explanation for each translation, even without knowledge of Classical Chinese or Mandarin. The goal is to improve upon the default practice of producing secondary translations that do not reference the primary text (e.g., a Persian translation of the Cyropaedia based on two English translations).
 but also because a modern language translation aligned to a source text that is, in turn, aligned to a network of rich linguistic and cultural annotation can spawn a range of additional translations. 

* New systems to analyze texts at scale and to support new forms of close, philological reading.
