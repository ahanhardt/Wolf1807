# Working materials for a Smart Ajax

This folder contains a number of files for a "smart text" of Sophocles Ajax, to be developed in conjunction with a "Smart Homer." Our particular focus is on a "smart apparatus" -- developing an apparatus criticus (a list of variant readings) that distinguishes between different classes of variation. The goal is to help readers identify variations of interest to them from a potentially large set of variants. Different readers may look for:

* Changes in languages that leave traces in manuscripts (e.g., confusion of different vowels as Greek speakers increasingly pronounced different vowels as -i-). These variants may actually not appear in the textual notes of critical editions as they may rarely or never help us reconstruct the original text. 

* Variants that challenge us to change the morpho-syntactic analysis recorded in a Treebank.

* Variants that do not change our reconstructed text but that change our morpho-syntactic analyses (e.g., alternative ways to treebank the same sentence). Such variants do not appear in traditional textual notes but are crucial components to any fully developed smart text.

* Variants that force us to change the accompanying modern langauge translation.(Note that smart texts must include at least one modern langauge translation that has been optimized, insofar as possible, for machine transation into other languages).

* Variants translations of the texrt as it stands. The range of variation among modern translations will always be substantial but smart texts should help readers asses variants that appear in existing translations and that *could* appear. In the latter case, readers should have access to the best possible methods to determine possible variations in translation (e.g., identification of particularly polysemous terms or of multiple plausible syntactic analyses). Each of these tasks is clearly challenging.
